# Labyrinth_game
The program I wrote in Python is a game. The player is placed in a labyrinth and has to find the
exit. During the game, the player collects valuable items and keys which he can use
to open next chambers. In chambers there are hidden monsters with which the player
fights if he enters the chamber.
